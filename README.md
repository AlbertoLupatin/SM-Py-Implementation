# Smith-Waterman Algorithm for Local Sequence Alignment  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements the **Smith-Waterman algorithm**, a dynamic programming approach for **local sequence alignment**.  
It identifies the most similar subsequences between two given DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, using **affine gap penalties** and a substitution matrix.  

This project was developed as part of the *Algorithmics for Bioinformatics* course at the **University of Trento**.  

## üöÄ Features  
- Implements the **Smith-Waterman algorithm** for local alignment.  
- Supports **custom scoring matrices** (e.g., PAM, BLOSUM).  
- Uses **affine gap penalties** for improved accuracy.  
- Outputs the **optimal local alignment** with a traceback mechanism.  
- Efficient implementation with **dynamic programming**.  

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script with:
```
python smith_waterman.py -s1 SEQUENCE1 -s2 SEQUENCE2 -m MATRIX -g GAP_PENALTY
```

**Parameters**
	‚Ä¢	-s1 and -s2: Input sequences (DNA, RNA, or Protein).
	‚Ä¢	-m: Scoring matrix (PAM, BLOSUM, or a custom file).
	‚Ä¢	-g: Gap penalty (negative value).

The modified version of the program returns all the alignments satisfying the following conditions:
1.‚Å† ‚Å†Alignment score >= 60% of the maximum score alignment
2.‚Å† ‚Å†‚Å†Number of gaps >= 1
3.‚Å† ‚Å†‚Å†At least 1 occurrence of at least 3 consecutive matches

Alignments satisfying the 3 conditions are ordered by their alignment length (from the higher to lower)   
Overlaps in trace-back paths are allowed.
